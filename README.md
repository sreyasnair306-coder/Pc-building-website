📝 Devlog

The BuildMyPC project was created as a lightweight and beginner-friendly PC builder using only front-end technologies. The development started with a dark-themed UI and a simple budget-based recommendation system. Customization options were later added to allow users to modify parts while keeping the default build as a suggestion. A dark/light theme toggle and localStorage support were implemented to improve user experience and persistence. The entire project was kept in a single HTML file to ensure simplicity and offline usability.
